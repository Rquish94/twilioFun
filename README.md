# twilioFun
Originally meant to be a remote crypto trader with Twilio. Ended up just making a web scrapers which would do specific events upon text messages sent to the Twilio account.
Keep in mind this is untouched code from when i was younger.

I believe Main was the first iteration, app being the second.

Some of the functions:

Look up weather (daily and weekly)

Look up distance between two points

A Whois lookup

I began working on something similar which would check flight prices and text you when they drop. (temp)
